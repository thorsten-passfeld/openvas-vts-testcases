# VTs Testing Program

This is the testing program that can use all available test cases to run a test. It uses the target emulator for emulating a recorded host that is then scanned using OpenVAS.
Lastly, the results of this scan are compared to the recorded results inside a test case to determine if a VT's behavior changed between the recording and the present day.
